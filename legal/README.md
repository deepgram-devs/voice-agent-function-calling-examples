# Advanced Legal Document Analysis and Contract Management

The AI can assist in analyzing legal documents, tracking contract deadlines, and even generating basic legal documents.
Use Case:

## Prompt:

"Review this contract and alert me of any clauses that mention late payment penalties. Also, set a reminder for 3 days before the contract deadline."

## Functions:

    analyze_document(document: str, keyword: str): Analyzes the contract and highlights sections related to "late payment penalties."
    set_reminder(date: str, task: str): Schedules a reminder for an important date.
    generate_contract(type: str, details: dict): Generates a standard legal contract.

## Workflow:

    AI calls analyze_document(contract_text, "late payment penalties") to review the document for any relevant clauses.
    It uses set_reminder(contract_deadline - 3 days, "Review contract") to schedule a reminder.

## Response:

"I found a clause regarding late payment penalties on page 3 of the contract. I've also set a reminder for 3 days before the contract's deadline."
