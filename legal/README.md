# Advanced Legal Document Analysis and Contract Management

The AI can assist in analyzing legal documents, tracking contract deadlines, and even generating basic legal documents.

## Prompt:

`Prompt:` "Review this contract and alert me of any clauses that mention late payment penalties. Also, set a reminder for 3 days before the contract deadline."

## Functions:

### Analyze Document

This function analyzes a text document by searching for a keyword (e.g., "late payment penalties"). It highlights and returns any sections containing the keyword, showing their respective line numbers.


```python
# Mock implementation of the analyze_document function
def analyze_document(document: str, keyword: str):
    # Simulate analyzing the document for a specific keyword
    highlighted_sections = []
    document_lines = document.split('\n')  # Split document by lines for analysis
    for i, line in enumerate(document_lines):
        if keyword.lower() in line.lower():
            highlighted_sections.append(f"Line {i+1}: {line}")

    if highlighted_sections:
        return f"Sections related to '{keyword}':\n" + "\n".join(highlighted_sections)
    else:
        return f"No sections found related to '{keyword}'."
```
### Set Reminder

This function simulates setting a reminder for a specific date and task (e.g., "Submit contract to client"). It returns a confirmation message.

```python
    # Mock implementation of the set_reminder function
    def set_reminder(date: str, task: str):
    # Simulate setting a reminder for a task on a specific date
    return f"Reminder set for {date} to: {task}"
```

### Workflow: Generate Contract

This function generates a legal contract using a pre-defined template (e.g., employment, lease, sale). It takes a dictionary of details and inserts them into the appropriate contract template.

```python
# Mock implementation of the generate_contract function
def generate_contract(contract_type: str, details: dict):
    # Simulate generating a legal contract based on the type and details provided
    contract_templates = {
        "employment": "This is an Employment Agreement between {employer} and {employee}. Start Date: {start_date}.",
        "lease": "This is a Lease Agreement between {landlord} and {tenant}. The lease term starts on {start_date}.",
        "sale": "This is a Sale Agreement between {seller} and {buyer}. The product will be delivered on {delivery_date}."
    }

    template = contract_templates.get(contract_type.lower(), "Contract type not recognized.")

    if template != "Contract type not recognized.":
        # Replace placeholders in the template with actual details
        contract_text = template.format(**details)
        return f"Generated {contract_type} contract:\n{contract_text}"
    else:
        return template

 # Example usage

# Example 1: Analyze document for a specific keyword
document_text = """
This is a contract for services rendered.
Late payment penalties will apply after 30 days of non-payment.
The client agrees to the payment terms stated herein.
"""
keyword = "late payment penalties"
analysis_result = analyze_document(document_text, keyword)
print(analysis_result)

# Example 2: Set a reminder for an important task
reminder_date = "2024-10-15"
task = "Submit contract to client"
reminder_status = set_reminder(reminder_date, task)
print(reminder_status)

# Example 3: Generate a contract based on the contract type and details
contract_type = "employment"
contract_details = {
    "employer": "ABC Corp",
    "employee": "John Doe",
    "start_date": "November 1, 2024"
}
contract_text = generate_contract(contract_type, contract_details)
print(contract_text)

```


## Workflow:

1. AI calls `analyze_document(contract_text, "late payment penalties"`)` to review the document for any relevant clauses.
2. It uses `set_reminder(contract_deadline - 3 days, "Review contract")` to schedule a reminder.

## Response:

`Response:` "I found a clause regarding late payment penalties on page 3 of the contract. I've also set a reminder for 3 days before the contract's deadline."
