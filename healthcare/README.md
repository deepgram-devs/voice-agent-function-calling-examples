# Healthcare Appointment Scheduling and Prescription Management

In healthcare, the AI could handle appointment scheduling with doctors, manage patient records, and even help with prescription refills.

## Prompt:

`Prompt:` "I need to schedule an appointment with my cardiologist and refill my blood pressure medication."

## Functions:

### Fulfill Prescription

This function simulates sending a request to refill a specific medication at a designated pharmacy. If the medication is blood pressure-related, it processes the request and returns a confirmation message.

```python
# Mock implementation of the request_prescription_refill function
def request_prescription_refill(medication: str, pharmacy: str):
    # Simulate sending a prescription refill request
    if medication.lower() == "blood pressure medication":
        return f"Refill request for {medication} sent to {pharmacy}."
    else:
        return f"Refill request for {medication} not processed. Please contact your doctor."
```

### Schedule Appointment

 This function simulates scheduling an appointment with a specific doctor, making sure the specialty is correctly provided (e.g., "Cardiologist"). If successful, it returns a confirmation of the appointment.

```python

# Mock implementation of the schedule_appointment function
def schedule_appointment(doctor: str, specialty: str, date: str):
    # Simulate scheduling an appointment
    if specialty.lower() == "cardiologist":
        return f"Appointment scheduled with Dr. {doctor}, Cardiologist, on {date}."
    else:
        return f"Appointment not scheduled. Please ensure the specialty is correct."

# Example usage
medication = "Blood Pressure Medication"
pharmacy = "Walgreens"
refill_status = request_prescription_refill(medication, pharmacy)
print(refill_status)

doctor = "Smith"
specialty = "Cardiologist"
date = "October 20, 2024"
appointment_status = schedule_appointment(doctor, specialty, date)
print(appointment_status)

```

## Workflow:

1. AI calls `schedule_appointment("Dr. Smith", "Cardiology", "October 20th")` to book the appointment.
2. It then uses `request_prescription_refill("Lisinopril", "CVS Pharmacy")` to manage the medication refill.

## Response:

`Response:` "Your appointment with Dr. Smith has been scheduled for October 20th, and your prescription for Lisinopril will be ready for pickup at CVS Pharmacy."
