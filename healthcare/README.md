# Healthcare Appointment Scheduling and Prescription Management

In healthcare, the AI could handle appointment scheduling with doctors, manage patient records, and even help with prescription refills.
Use Case:

## Prompt:

"I need to schedule an appointment with my cardiologist and refill my blood pressure medication."

## Functions:

schedule_appointment(doctor: str, specialty: str, date: str): Books an appointment with a cardiologist.

request_prescription_refill(medication: str, pharmacy: str): Sends a request to refill the blood pressure medication at the user's preferred pharmacy.

## Workflow:

    AI calls schedule_appointment("Dr. Smith", "Cardiology", "October 20th") to book the appointment.
    It then uses request_prescription_refill("Lisinopril", "CVS Pharmacy") to manage the medication refill.

## Response:

Response: "Your appointment with Dr. Smith has been scheduled for October 20th, and your prescription for Lisinopril will be ready for pickup at CVS Pharmacy."
