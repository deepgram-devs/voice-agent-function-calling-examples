# Customer Support

AI can help manage customer support tickets, troubleshoot technical issues, and even reset passwords or configure settings in a SaaS platform.

## Prompt

"Iâ€™m unable to access my account, and I need help with configuring my email integration."

## Functions

### Reset Password

Simulates sending a password reset link to the given user. It returns a string indicating that the reset link has been sent.

```python

    # Mock implementation of the reset_password function
def reset_password(user_id: str):
    # Simulate sending a password reset link
    return f"Password reset link has been sent to the user with ID: {user_id}"

```
### Troubleshoot Issue

Takes an issue description and returns a troubleshooting solution. The solutions are predefined for certain issues (e.g., email integration, login problems).

```python
def troubleshoot_issue(issue: str):
    # Simulate diagnosing a technical issue with a simple mock response
    issue_solutions = {
        "email integration": "Check your SMTP settings and ensure the server is reachable.",
        "login problem": "Ensure your username and password are correct and try resetting the password.",
        "slow performance": "Try clearing the cache and restarting the system."
    }
    return issue_solutions.get(issue.lower(), "Issue not recognized. Please contact support.")
```

### Configure Email Integration

Accepts user-specific email configuration settings in the form of a dictionary and returns a confirmation message indicating the settings have been applied.

```python
def configure_email_integration(user_id: str, settings: dict):
    # Simulate configuring email settings
    return f"Email integration has been configured for user ID: {user_id} with the following settings: {settings}"

# Example usage
user_id = "user123"
issue = "email integration"
email_settings = {
    "SMTP server": "smtp.example.com",
    "port": 587,
    "encryption": "TLS",
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}

# Call the functions
print(reset_password(user_id))
print(troubleshoot_issue(issue))
print(configure_email_integration(user_id, email_settings))
```

## Response:

"I've sent a password reset link to your email and reconfigured your email integration settings based on your requirements."
